<h1 style="text-align: center;">I ❤️ Rust and Quantum Mechanics</h1>

<p>Hey there! <span class="emoji">👋</span> I'm Abhinn Pandey, but you can call me Abiinkun on the internet. <span class="emoji">🌟</span> I'm a 15-year-old student with big dreams and a passion for all things tech and science. <span class="emoji">🚀</span></p>

    <h2>My Ambitions</h2>
    <p>I'm on a journey to become a physicist specializing in quantum mechanics. <span class="emoji">🧠✨</span> The mysteries of the quantum world fascinate me, and I'm excited to dive deep into the fundamental workings of the universe. <span class="emoji">🌌🔬</span></p>

    <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
    <p>When I'm not immersed in quantum physics, you'll often find me exploring my other loves: robotics <span class="emoji">🤖</span> and game development <span class="emoji">🎮</span>. There's something incredibly satisfying about building robots and creating games that people enjoy. The creativity and problem-solving involved in these hobbies keep me motivated and inspired.</p>

    <h2>Favorite Programming Languages</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Rust and C#</strong> <span class="emoji">🦀</span>: My favorite language! I love Rust and C# for its performance and safety features. It’s like a powerful tool that helps me build robust and efficient software.</li>

        <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>PHP</strong>: 
			WORST Language <span class="emoji">😅</span> While they’re useful, but they are worst than the alternatives, PROUDLY WROTE THE WEBSITE in TYPESCRIPT</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>In Summary</h2>
    <p>I'm a curious and driven student with a passion for quantum mechanics, robotics, and game development. With Rust as my trusty companion and a keen interest in the cutting-edge fields of science and technology, I'm excited about the future and the endless possibilities it holds. <span class="emoji">🌟🔧💻</span></p>
